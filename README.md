# Guess who with League of Legends theme

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
Creating a version of the popular Guess who game with javascript. The player can guess which champion is the secret one by asking questions about their traits. The answers turns into clues by filtering remaining champions.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
Built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I had a lot of issues with getting my if else statements to work in the beginning but I got good guidance from my classmates. After that I solved next steps in the Javascript more easily.I used sketchboard.io to get a good overview of my champions that I wanted to have on the board and their characteristics and traits. I also focused on creating global variables to be able to use audio effects in several function/eventlisteners. If I had more time I would have made a front page at the start of the game where the player can insert their name before playing. I also did not get the time to make a timer but am satisfied with getting a guess counter and my over all design. Also applied some animation to flip the cards while hovering the champions, this caused some issues in mobile view where the guess button disappeared. Solved it by adding position absolute on my .card guess div.
